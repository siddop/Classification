------*** all the codes in the templates require python3 and libraries like numpy, sikitlearn and pandas to run*** -------

the classification folder contain 6 sub-folder named 

Decision_tree_classification (in this folder one can find templates for decision tree classification using a dataset)

K_NEAREST_NEIGHBOURS (in this folder one can find template for knn classification)

Kernel SVM (in this folder one can find sample code for Kernel svm)

Naive_bayes (in this folder one can find example of naive_bayes classification)

Random forest (In this folder one can find sample of random forest classification model)

SVM (in this folder one can find the example using SVM model)
